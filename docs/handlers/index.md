# Handlers

SnappyRouter uses a number of different route handlers to serve web and CLI
requests. Handlers are a core component in the router and are the starting point
for customizing the router for your own application.

## What is a Handler?

The router makes very few assumptions about the executing environment (command
line, web server, folder structure, etc). To handle each environment
differently, the router passes off control to a handler. The handler is
responsible for most of the routing logic.

## Built-in Handlers

SnappyRouter provides a number of built in routing handlers.

### Controller Handler

The controller handler provides the "VC" part of MVC. The router assumes your
web requests match a pattern such as
`/prefix/controller/action/param1/param2` and will attempt to find the
appropriate controller and action to invoke. Furthermore, the Twig view engine
can be initialized to provide an easy to use controller-view binding.

[More details](controller_handler.md)

### Rest Handler

The rest handler provides REST-like API urls such as
`/api/v1.2/resource/1234` and extends the Controller Handler to route to an
appropriate controller. Responses are encoded as JSON by default.

[More details](rest_handler.md)

### Pattern Match Handler

The pattern match handler uses the powerful
[FastRoute](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute) library to allow custom routes
to map directly to a callable function. This handler will seem familiar to users
of [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) or [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/).

### Direct Script Handler

This handler allows the route to fall through to an existing PHP script. If your
application entry points are paths to scripts directly this handler can be used
to wrap access to those scripts through the router.

### CLI Task Handler

This handler provides a command line entry point for tasks.

### JSON-RPC Handler

This handler is for exposing class methods to remote clients via the JSON-RPC
protocol, versions 1 and 2.

## Writing your own Handler

Every application has unique conventions and workflows. SnappyRouter handlers
are easy to extend and building you can write your own handler for any custom
routing your application may need.

To begin, add a class that extends one of the abstract handler classes. For a
web request handler, it is recommended to extend
`Vectorface\\SnappyRouter\\Handler\\AbstractRequestHandler`.

```php
<?php

namespace Vendor\MyNamespace\Handler;

use Vectorface\SnappyRouter\Handler\AbstractRequestHandler;

class MyCustomHandler extends AbstractRequestHandler
{
    /**
     * Returns true if the handler determines it should handle this request and false otherwise.
     * @param string $path The URL path for the request.
     * @param array $query The query parameters.
     * @param array $post The post data.
     * @param string $verb The HTTP verb used in the request.
     * @return boolean Returns true if this handler will handle the request and false otherwise.
     */
    public function isAppropriate($path, $query, $post, $verb)
    {
        // apply some logic using the parameters to determine whether the
        // handler is appropriate for this request
        return true;
    }

    /**
     * Performs the actual routing.
     * @return mixed Returns the result of the route.
     */
    public function performRoute()
    {
        // perform the actual routing logic here
    }
}
```

and specify the handler in your config:

```php
<?php

use Vectorface\SnappyRouter\Config\Config;
use Vendor\MyNamespace\Handler\MyCustomHandler;

$config = new Config([
    Config::KEY_HANDLERS => [
        'MyHandler' => [
            Config::KEY_CLASS => MyCustomHandler::class,
            Config::KEY_OPTIONS => [
                // an array of options
            ]
        ]
    ]
]);
$router = new Vectorface\SnappyRouter\SnappyRouter($config);
echo $router->handleRoute();
```
